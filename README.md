Running different tests to do a statistical analysis of the character dice in the video game, Super MarioParty.

I'm so sorry for all of this. Contrary to what may seem fine at the time, the hours between 8 PM and midnight are not the optimal times to be programming and bashing away at these kinds of simulations, lol.
